## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete testing documentation for the **Urban Scooter** platform. I managed the end-to-end Quality Assurance process, from requirement analysis to final bug reporting, ensuring a seamless experience for both users and couriers across web and mobile environments.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **Methodologies:** Black Box Testing, Boundary Value Analysis (BVA), Equivalence Partitioning, Regression Testing.
* **Tools:** SQL (PostgreSQL), Postman (API Testing), Draw.io (Mind Maps & Flowcharts), Google Sheets.
* **Environments Tested:** Mobile (Android Studio API 28 "Pie"), Web (Google Chrome & Opera).

## 📊 Strategic Tasks Executed

### 1️⃣ Requirement Analysis & SQL (Task 1)
* Validated complex business logic using **SQL queries**.
* Performed feasibility analysis for test automation vs. manual testing, prioritizing ROI and project stability.

### 2️⃣ UI/UX & Data Validation (Task 2)
* **Checklists:** Designed for "Order Status" and "Main Header" modules.
* **Boundary Value Analysis:** Applied to critical input fields to ensure data integrity.
* **Visual Documentation:** Developed system flowcharts and mind maps to visualize complex user journeys.

### 3️⃣ Test Case Design & Execution (Task 3)
* Designed and executed high-priority test cases for mobile devices.
* Identified critical inconsistencies in environment-specific behaviors (Chrome vs. Android).

### 4️⃣ API Testing & Documentation (Task 4)
* Validated REST endpoints for courier and order management.
* Verified status codes (200, 201, 400, 404) and confirmed JSON response accuracy against technical specifications.

## 🐞 Top Critical Bug Reports
I identified several **Blocker** and **High-Severity** defects during the execution phase:

* **[PUS-24] - [CRITICAL] Push Notification Failure:** A backend defect prevented notifications from being triggered on Android, a critical gap for courier operations.
* **[PUS-22] - [BLOCKER] Order Button Failure:** The "Order" button was non-functional in Google Chrome, completely preventing user conversions.
* **[PUS-25] - Data Validation Risk:** Lack of field sanitization in "Courier Creation," allowing unauthorized special characters and threatening database integrity.
* **[PUS-23] - UX Inconsistency:** UI label mismatch ("OK" button vs. expected requirements) in the "No Internet" modal.

## 🎯 Career & Professional Goals
Having successfully completed this intensive Bootcamp, I am now moving into the **Career Acceleration Program**. 
* **Focus:** International QA opportunities (United States / Spain).
* **Current Path:** Enhancing English proficiency and advancing into Test Automation (Selenium/Cypress).
